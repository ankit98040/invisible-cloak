# invisible-cloak
invisible cloak using openCv-python

## Getting Started

If you are a Harry Potter fan , you would know what an Invisibility Cloak is.
Yes! Itâ€™s the cloak that makes Harry Potter invisible.
 This happen with few line of python code in OpenCV.

1. Capture and store the background frame [ This will be done for some seconds ]
2. Detect the red colored cloth using color detection and segmentation algorithm.
3. Segment out the red colored cloth by generating a mask. [ used in code ]
4. Generate the final augmented output to create a magical effect.

### Prerequisites

You need to install the following libraries

```
import cv2
import time
import numpy as np

```

### Installing

Aa step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo


## Running the tests

# in order to check the cv2 version  
```python
print(cv2.__version__)   
```

# taking video as input through webCam 
```python
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0) 
```

# give the camera to warm up 
```python
time.sleep(2)
background=0  
```

# capturing the background in range of 60 
```python
for i in range(30):
    ret,background = cap.read()
```

# we are reading from video 
```python
while(cap.isOpened()):
    ret , img = cap.read()

    if not ret:
        break
```
# convert the image - BGR to HSV 
# as we focused on detection of red color  
  
# converting BGR to HSV for better  
# detection or you can convert it to gray 
```python
 hsv = cv2.cvtColor(img , cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)
```

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
